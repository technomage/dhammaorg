<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Why is the course ten days long?</h3>
<p>
  Actually, the ten-day course is the minimum; it provides an
  essential introduction and foundation to the technique. To develop
  in the practice is a lifetime job. Experience over generations has
  shown that if Vipassana is taught in periods of less than ten days,
  the student does not get a sufficient experiential grasp of the
  technique. Traditionally, Vipassana was taught in retreats
  lasting seven weeks. With the dawning of the 20th century, the
  teachers of this tradition began to experiment with shorter times
  to suit the quickening pace of life. They tried thirty days, two
  weeks, ten days, down to seven days--and they found that less than
  ten days is not enough time for the mind to settle down and work
  deeply with the mind-body phenomenon.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>How many hours a day will I be meditating?</h3>
<p>
  The day begins at 4:00 a.m. with a wakeup bell and continues
  until 9:00 p.m.  There are about ten hours of meditation throughout
  the day, interspersed with regular breaks and rest periods. Every
  evening at 7:00 p.m. there is a videotaped lecture by the Teacher,
  S.N. Goenka, which provides a context for meditators to understand
  their experience of the day. This schedule has proved workable and
  beneficial for hundreds of thousands of people for decades.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>What language is used in the course?</h3>
<p>
  The teaching is given through recordings of S.N. Goenka, speaking
  in English or Hindi, together with a translation into a local
  language.  Tape translations exist in most of the major languages
  of the world, including English.
  If the teachers conducting a course do not speak the local language
  fluently, interpreters will be there to help.
  Language is usually no barrier for someone who wants to join a
  course.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>How much does the course cost?</h3>
<p>
  Each student who attends a Vipassana course is given this gift by
  a previous student. There is no charge for either the teaching, or
  for room and board. All Vipassana courses worldwide are run on a
  strictly voluntary donation basis. At the end of your course, if
  you have benefited from the experience, you are welcome to donate
  for the coming course, according to your volition and your means.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>How much are teachers paid to conduct courses?</h3>
<p>
  Teachers receive no payment, donations or other material benefit.
  They are required to have their own private means of support. This
  rule means that some of them may have less time for teaching, but
  it protects students from exploitation and it guards against
  commercialism. In this tradition, teachers give Vipassana purely
  as a service to others. All they get is the satisfaction of
  seeing people's happiness at the end of ten days. 
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>I can't sit cross legged. Can I meditate?</h3>
<p>
  Certainly. Chairs are provided for those unable to sit
  comfortably on the floor because of age or a physical problem.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>I'm on a special diet. Can I bring my own food?</h3>
<p>
  If your doctor has prescribed a special diet, let us know and we
  will see whether we can provide what you need. If the diet is
  too specialized or would interfere with meditation, we might have
  to ask you to wait until you can be more flexible. We're sorry
  but students are required to choose from the food provided to
  them, rather than bring food for themselves. Most people find
  the choice is ample and they enjoy the simple vegetarian diet.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Can pregnant women attend courses? Are there any special arrangements or instructions for them?</h3>
<p>
  Pregnant women may certainly attend, and many women come
  specifically during pregnancy to take advantage of the
  opportunity to work deeply and in silence during this special
  time. We ask pregnant women to ensure they are confident
  that their pregnancy is stable before applying. We provide the
  extra food they need and ask them to work in a relaxed way.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Why is a course conducted in silence?</h3>
<p>
  All students attending the course observe "noble silence"
  &mdash; that is, silence of body, speech and mind. They agree to
  refrain from communicating with their co-meditators. However,
  students are free to contact the management about their material
  needs, and to speak with the instructor. Silence is observed for
  the first nine full days. On the tenth day, speech is resumed as
  a way of re-establishing the normal pattern of daily life.
  Continuity of practice is the secret of success in this course;
  silence is an essential component in maintaining this continuity.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>How can I be sure I am capable of doing the meditation?</h3>
<p>
  For a person in reasonable physical and mental health who is
  genuinely interested and willing to make a sincere effort,
  meditation (including "noble silence") is not difficult.
  If you are able to follow the instructions patiently and
  diligently, you can be sure of tangible results.  Though it
  may appear daunting, the day's schedule is neither too severe
  nor too relaxed. Moreover, the presence of other students
  practicing conscientiously in a peaceful and conducive
  atmosphere lends tremendous support to one's efforts.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Is there anyone who should not participate in a course?</h3>
<p>
  Obviously someone who is physically too weak to follow the
  schedule will not be able to benefit from a course. The same
  is true of someone suffering from psychiatric problems, or
  someone undergoing emotional upheaval. Through a process of
  questions and answers, we will be able to help you decide
  clearly beforehand whether you are in a position to benefit
  fully from a course. In some cases applicants are asked to
  get approval from their doctor before they can be accepted.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Can Vipassana cure physical or mental diseases?</h3>
<p>
  Many diseases are caused by our inner agitation. If the
  agitation is removed, the disease may be alleviated or
  disappear. But learning Vipassana with the aim of curing
  a disease is a mistake that never works. People who try to
  do this waste their time because they are focusing on the
  wrong goal. They may even harm themselves. They will
  neither understand the meditation properly nor succeed in
  getting rid of the disease.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>How about depression? Does Vipassana cure that?</h3>
<p>
  Again, the purpose of Vipassana is not to cure diseases.
  Someone who really practices Vipassana learns to be happy
  and balanced in all circumstances.  But a person with a
  history of severe depression may not be able to apply the
  technique properly and may not get the desired results.
  The best thing for such a person is to work with a
  health professional. Vipassana teachers are meditation
  experts, not psychotherapists. 
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Can Vipassana make people mentally unbalanced?</h3>
<p>
  No. Vipassana teaches you to be aware and equanimous,
  that is, balanced, despite all the ups and downs of life.
  But if someone comes to a course concealing serious
  emotional problems, that person may be unable to understand
  the technique or to apply it properly to achieve the desired
  results. This is why it is important to let us know your
  past history so that we can judge whether you will benefit
  from a course.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Do I have to be a Buddhist to practice Vipassana?</h3>
<p>
  People from many religions and no religion have found the
  meditation course helpful and beneficial. Vipassana is an
  art of living, a way of life. While it is the essence of
  what the Buddha taught, it is not a religion; rather, it
  is the cultivation of human values leading to a life which
  is good for oneself and good for others.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Why do I have to stay for the entire ten days?</h3>
<p>
  Vipassana is taught step by step, with a new step added
  each day to the end of the course. If you leave early, you
  do not learn the full teaching and do not give the technique
  a chance to work for you. Also, by meditating intensively,
  a course participant initiates a process that reaches
  fulfillment with the completion of the course. Interrupting
  the process before completion is not advisable.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>Is it dangerous to leave a course early?</h3>
<p>
  The point is that leaving early is shortchanging yourself.
  You don't give yourself a chance to learn the full technique
  and so you won't be able to apply it successfully in daily
  life. You also interrupt the process in the middle rather
  than letting it come to the proper conclusion. To get home a
  day or two early, you waste all the time you have invested.
</p>
<h3 class='www-h3'>How about the tenth day, when talking is allowed and serious meditation stops? Can I leave then?</h3>
<p>
  The tenth day is a very important transition back to ordinary
  life. No one is permitted to leave on that day.
